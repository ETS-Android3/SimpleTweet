## Notes

This app took the most time for me to build Because there are multiple challenges that I have faced. At first, my app was crashing because of gusing my own API. I was allowed to login to the app, but it kept on giving the error message 'Authentication token has been expired or previously used. That is why, I used the API keys provided by CodePath. Afterwards, there was an unknown file called 'values31.xml' popped up into my project. It kept on giving me the error message 'Android resource linking failed. I had to change my dependency to this following line 'implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.5.0-alpha02'.
